        <p> I’m alway looking for anything new. I love trying different things shuch as drawing, writing and other thing. One of the new things that i learned it called ” Origami” the Origami is the Japanese word from paper folding. ORI means to fold and GAMI means paper. I am also a big fan of the professional origamist Jeremy Shafer. His designs give me an idea of my designs.Origami involves the creation of paper forms usually entirely by folding Animals, birds, fish, toys, and makes are among the models that even very young children can learn to make in just one sitting. I started doing this hobby last year and i did a lot of thing. I love it and i’m working hard to be professional in this hobby.</p>
